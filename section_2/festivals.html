                        <strong>Samhain</strong> is a Gaelic festival on the first of November to mark the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter, with heavy associations with Irish Gaelic mythology.
                        <br>The festival was observed throughout Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man.
                        <br>
                        <br>The first mention of the festival is from 9th century, in the earliest Irish literature, being mentioned alongside other important events in Irish mythology.

                <h4>Historic Customs and Beliefs</h4>
                <p>
                    According the Irish mythology, during Samhain, the door to the Otherworld opened and the barrier between our world was breachable, 
                    allowing allowing mythical creatures such as fairies, supernatural beings, spirits and sidhs to pass through.
                    <br>The Celts would <strong>dress up as monsters and animals</strong> as to ward off these creatures and not be kidnapped. 
                    They would also leave out offerings of food and drink to appease these spirits to ensure people and livestock survived the winter.
                    <br>Some also believed the souls of deceased friends and family would revisit their homes and so a place was set at the table for them.
                </p>
                <h4>Ritual Bonfires</h4>
                <p>At Samhain, bonfires were lit at hilltops, with rituals usually involved. Sources suggest that these fires were to imitate the Sun.</p>

                        <h4>Games and Divination</h4>
                        <p>Household gatherings were held throughout Gaelic regions, where games that held divine or ritualistic significance were played.
                            These usually were related to <strong>death and marriage</strong>, with apples and walnuts usually being used in these games. 
                            <br>A common example of this was <strong>apple bobbing</strong>, where a basin was filled with water and apples are dropped in. 
                            The apples will float on the surface and participants have to use their mouth to retrieve an apple, with arms being strickly forbidden and could be tied behind the participants back.

                        <p>This is an eighteenth century tale to explain why people celebrate Samhain, or more specifically, Halloween.
                            <br>A grumpy blacksmith named "Stingy Jack" invites the devil for a drink, but refuses to pay the tab. 
                            He convinces the devil to shape into a coin to pay, but instead sticks the devil into his pocket, whihc has a silver cross in it,
                            preventing the devil from transforming back.

                        <br>Jack and the devil strike a deal, that inexchange for the devils release, the devil agrees to leave Jack alone for a year and when Jack dies,
                        not be allowed into Hell. To which the devil agrees.
                        <br>Fastforward, Jack dies, and being true to his word, the devil bars Jack from entering hell, but Jack is also prevented from entering Heaven due to how he lived.
                        So he is fated to walk forever in eternal darkness, but the devil takes pity, and gives Jack a lump of coal to light his way.
                        Jack carves out a turnip and sticks the coal inside to create a lantern. Hence the word "Jack O' Lantern".
                        <br>Now every Halloween, when the barrier between our world and the undead is the weakest, Jack comes knocking at people's doors asking to be let in.
                        <br>And to ward him off, households are decorated and people dress up as monsters.

                                death of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland and marks the introduction of Christanity to Ireland.

                    <h4>What happens during Saint Patricks Day?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The celebration of Saint Patrick's Day is generally done through public parades, the wearing of green attire, indulging in Irish
                        culture such as poems, literature and music and the mass consumption of alchohol.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Who was Saint Patrick?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Much of what we know about Saint Patrick was written and recorded allegedly by himself in a religious piece called the <strong>Declaration</strong>.
                        <br>Saint Patrick was born in the 5th century to a wealthy Roman-British family. At sixteen years old, he was captured and brought
                        to Ireland by Irish raiders where he was enslaved. He spent six years working as a shepard and in that time, he found God.
                        <br>The Decleration says that God had told Patrick to flee to the coast where a boat will be waiting for him to return home, where he became a priest.
                        <br>Patrick returned to Ireland to convert the then Pagan Irish to Christanity, with these efforts being turned into an allegory where
                        he drove "snakes", out of Ireland.
