                Romanian traditional music reflects the country's cultural diversity, with 
                instruments like the bagpipe, pan flute, and lute. Each region has unique 
                styles; Transylvania's haunting violin melodies contrast with Dobrogea's 
                Turkish and Balkan influences.

            <p>
                Throughout history, music in Romania has also been a form of resistance 
                and political expression. During the communist era, folk and rock music 
                often carried subtle messages of dissent. Even today, artists use their 
                music to comment on social and political issues, resonating with audiences 
                seeking change.
