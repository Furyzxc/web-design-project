            <p>
                Romanian history begins with the ancient Dacians, a powerful civilization in 
                the Carpathian region known for their resilience and rich culture. In 106 AD, 
                the Roman Empire, under Emperor Trajan, conquered Dacia, integrating it into 
                the empire. This period left a lasting legacy, including Latin as the linguistic 
                foundation for the Romanian language. Roman influence is evident in artifacts, 
                architecture, and the enduring pride in Dacia's resistance and subsequent Romanization.

            <p>
                During the Middle Ages, the regions of Wallachia, Moldavia, and Transylvania 
                emerged as distinct political entities. Leaders like Vlad the Impaler defended 
                these principalities against external threats, particularly the Ottoman Empire, 
                which exerted significant influence.

            <p>
                The 19th century marked a turning point with the unification of Wallachia and 
                Moldavia in 1859, laying the foundation for modern Romania. The leadership of 
                Alexandru Ioan Cuza initiated reforms that strengthened the new state. Romania 
                gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877 and achieved full unification 
                with Transylvania in 1918, following World War I.

            <h2>Modern History and Communist Era</h2>
            <img src="images/Communism.jpg" alt="Communism">
            <p>
                The 20th century brought dramatic changes, including World War II and the 
                rise of communism. Under Nicolae Ceau»ôescu's regime, Romania experienced 
                both industrialization and oppression, culminating in economic hardship 
                and the 1989 revolution. The fall of communism marked a new era of democracy 
                and integration into Western institutions like NATO and the European Union. 
                Today, Romania reflects on its tumultuous history as it navigates its place 
                in the modern world.
