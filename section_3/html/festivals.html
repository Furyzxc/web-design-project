                Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is the most important traditional festival in China.
            It usually falls between January and February and is celebrated with family reunions, fireworks, dragon and lion dances, and the famous red envelopes (hongbao).

            The celebrations last up to 15 days, culminating in the Lantern Festival, where people light colorful lanterns to symbolize letting go of the old and welcoming in the new.
