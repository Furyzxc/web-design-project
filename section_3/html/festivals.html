                Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is the most important traditional festival in China.
            It usually falls between January and February and is celebrated with family reunions, fireworks, dragon and lion dances, and the famous red envelopes (hongbao).
            Each year is associated with one of the 12 zodiac animals, each symbolizing different characteristics.
            The celebrations last up to 15 days, culminating in the Lantern Festival, where people light colorful lanterns to symbolize letting go of the old and welcoming in the new.

                (rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves).
                The festival commemorates the life and death of the famous Chinese poet Qu Yuan, who drowned himself in protest against corruption.
                People throw zongzi into the water to distract fish from his body.

                The Qingming Festival, also known as Tomb Sweeping Day, is a time to honor ancestors by visiting their graves and offering food, tea, and other items.
                It usually occurs on April 4th or 5th and is a solemn occasion to show respect for the deceased.
                The festival is rooted in ancient traditions, where families cleaned tombstones and made offerings to ensure good fortune and peace for the spirits of their ancestors.
